Dissolution

The feeling is hard to describe, english being such a limited language. The sensation of every piece of your body being ripped apart, your deepest layers of privacy being violated as the machine scans the very molecules of your body, only to feel every nerve stop reporting in, and then experience the void.

It's not just that you cease to be either, that I could deal with, but instead you are aware the entire time, the nanoseconds that seem an eternity as the data of which you now consist is transferred to your target location.

And then it's reversed. This is almost worse, the slow rebuilding of your body, the feeling as your limbs start to report back in, as your brain struggles to cope with the experience of being immaterial. Most people, the lucky ones, then forget about it, the entire happening fading away like a dream. I wish I was that lucky. Instead for me it remains, the feeling of gasping for air without lungs and trying to see without sight. And yet, I still do what I do, because if I didn't, who would?
